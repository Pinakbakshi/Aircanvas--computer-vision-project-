# Air Canvas: Gesture-Based Teaching Tool

This project demonstrates an interactive Air Canvas system that allows users to draw using hand gestures detected via a webcam.

## Features
- **Gesture Detection**: Uses Mediapipe for real-time hand tracking.
- **Interactive Drawing**: Draw on a virtual canvas with your index finger.
- **Clear Canvas**: Press 'c' to clear the canvas.
- **Exit Application**: Press 'q' to quit.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python air_canvas.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-user collaboration.
- Haptic feedback integration.
- Save drawings as images.

## Notes
- Ensure your webcam is functional.
- Run in a well-lit environment for better gesture detection.
